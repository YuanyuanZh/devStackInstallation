Step 0:
since I didn't have any experience in OpenStack, So I choose to do some research firstly
https://opensource.com/resources/what-is-openstack
https://www.openstack.org/assets/pdf-downloads/virtualization-Integration-whitepaper-2015.pdf

Step 1 :
install 
ubuntu 14.04 in  my VM

Step 2:
follow the guide in this link to install devstack
http://docs.openstack.org/developer/devstack/

first round, I install devstack under my personal account which has admin privileges
error 1 occurs:
	the installation stop automatically, and back to the login window, no error message shows	
solution: 
	I tried 2 time installation here, same error, so I checked my account permission and google it, 
	I think it due to account's privilegdes, so I decide to follow the guide add stack user firstly, 
	then install dexstack again under stack account


error 2 occurs:
	+ cp -p /opt/stack/keystone/etc/policy.json /etc/keystone
	cp: cannot create regular file '/etc/keystone/policy.json': Permission denied
solution :
	insert stack user with root privileges in sudoers file again manually
